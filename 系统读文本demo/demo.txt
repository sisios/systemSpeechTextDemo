Mr. Dufresne, describe...

...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

It was very bitter.


She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

If they say so.

I really don't remember.
I was upset.

What happened after you argued
with your wife?

She packed a bag.

She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

... whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.

Did you follow her?

I went to a few bars first.

Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

I parked in the turnout...


... and waited.

With what intention?

I'm not sure.

I was confused...

... drunk.

I think...

... mostly I wanted to scare them.

When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

I was sobering up.

I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

I've been very clear on this point.

I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

Yes, it does.

Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

...before the murders took place.

That's very convenient.

It's the truth.

The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

And that also...

...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

Since I am innocent of this crime...

...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

And most of all...

... we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

... lying dead in each other's arms.

They had sinned.

But was their crime so great...

... as to merit a death sentence?

While you think about that...

...think about this:

A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

No.

This was revenge...

...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

Four bullets per victim.

Not six shots fired, but eight.

That means that he fired
the gun empty...

... and then stopped to reload...

... so that he could shoot
each of them again.

An extra bullet per lover...

... right in the head.

You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

It chills my blood just to look at you.

By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

Sit.

We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

- Yes, sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

I mean, I learned my lesson.

I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

I'm no longer a danger to society.

That's God's honest truth.

Hey, Red.

How'd it go?

Same old shit, different day.

Yeah, I know how you feel.

I'm up for rejection next week.

Yeah, I got rejected last week.

It happens.

Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

Four!

There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

I'm the guy who can get it for you.

Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

... bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

Damn near anything within reason.
